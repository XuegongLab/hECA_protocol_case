# hECA_protocol_case
protocol cases

The `Tcell` and `labeltransfer` contain two cases for using hECA. The whole conda environment can be created by using the `environment.yml`:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

**Notice**: The above command only configures your python environment and the basic R environment. You still need to install `Seurat` and other R packages in the R command line.
